            <i>If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.</i> - John von Neumann

            <br><br>

            <i>The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them.</i> - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

            <i>I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth—which is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations—that mathematical ideas originate in empirics, although the genealogy is sometimes long and obscure. But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, than to anything else and, in particular, to an empirical science. There is, however, a further point which, I believe, needs stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from "reality" it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely l'art pour l'art. This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much "abstract" inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be easy to give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the very high baroque, but this, again, would be too technical.

            <br><br>

            In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this was a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that this will remain equally true in the future.</i>

            - John von Neumann

            A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. - Hunter S. Thompson

            You don't do any of the things you used to do. Now, you're nothing more than a door on the floor. - comic by Sam Brown

            This coffee is great. After I read some more internet and have another 14 cups, I'll be ready to get to work. - comic by Sam Brown

            And I've always been totally willing to hack things apart if I find a different way that fits better or a different partitioning. I've never been a lover of existing code. Code by itself almost rots and it's gotta be rewritten. Even when nothing has changed, for some reason it rots. - Ken Thompson

            In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice are equivalent. But, in practice, there is. - ???

            Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted but to weigh and consider. - Francis Bacon

            The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. - Richard Feynman

            Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. - Hanlon's razor
