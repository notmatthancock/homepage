    <h2>The secant line</h2>

    <u>Definition</u>: Given a curve, $f$, and two points on the graph of this curve, $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$, the secant is the straight line through these points.

    <br><br>

    <u>Remark</u>: the slope of the secant is found using the slope formula, $m = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$. The equation for the secant is found using the point-slope equation for a line: $y-f(x_1) = m (x-x_1)$

    <br><br>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    Let $f(x)=x^2$. Find the slope of the secant between when $x_1=1$, and when $x_2=-0.9, -0.99, 1.1, 1.01$. What is the slope of the tangent line when $x=1+h$? What happens when $h \to 0$?

    <br><br><br>

    The <u>tangent line</u> of a curve at a point, $(x,f(x))$ is said to "just touch" the curve at that point. Does the previous example suggest a way to give slope of this line by some limiting process? The slope of the tangent line at a point is defined to be the limit of the slopes of the secant line approximations around the tangenet line point.

    <h2>Velocity</h2>

    Suppose the position of a moving particle at a time, $t$, is given by the curve, $f(t$). Given two points in time, $t_1$ and $t_2$, the <u>average velocity</u>, over this is interval in time is given by:

    $$
        \text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{f(t_2) - f(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}
    $$

    <br><br>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    Suppose a ball is thrown into the air, and its height over time is given by $f(t) = 1+ 3t - t^2$. What is its average velocity from $t_1=0$ to $t_2=1$? $t_2=0.1$? $t_2=h$? What happens when $h \to 0$?

    <br><br>

    The <u>instantaneous velocity</u> at a time, $t$, is defined as the limit of average velocity about the time, $t$, as the size of the interval of time defining the average goes to zero.

    <br><br>

    In the last example what is instantaneous velocity when the ball is first thrown (i.e., when $t=0$)?

    <br><br>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    The following table shows a skateboarder's position at various times:
