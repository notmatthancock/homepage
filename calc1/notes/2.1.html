        <h1>2.1 - The tangent and velocity problems</h1>

        <h2>The secant line</h2>

        <div class="definition">Given a curve, $f$, and two points on the graph of this curve, $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$, the secant is the straight line through these points.</div>

        Recall that the slope of the secant is found using the slope formula, $m = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$. The equation for the secant is found using the point-slope equation for a line: $y-f(x_1) = m (x-x_1)$

        <div class="example">Let $f(x)=x^2$. Find the slope of the secant between when $x_1=1$, and when $x_2=0.9, 0.99, 1.1, 1.01$. (ans=1.9, 1.99, 2.01, 2.1) What is the slope of the tangent line when $x=1+h$? What happens when $h \to 0$?</div>

        The tangent line of a curve at a point, $(x,f(x))$ is easy to grasp intuitively, but how do we pin it down mathematically? Does the previous example suggest a way to give slope of this line by some limiting process?

        <div class="definition">The slope of the tangent line at a point is defined to be the limit of the slopes of the secant line approximations around the tangenet line point.</div>

        <h2>Velocity</h2>

        Suppose the position of a moving particle at a time, $t$, is given by the curve, $f(t$). Given two points in time, $t_1$ and $t_2$, the <u>average velocity</u>, over this is interval in time is given by:

        $$
            \text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{f(t_2) - f(t_1)}{t_2 - t_1}
        $$

        <div class="example">Suppose a ball is thrown into the air, and its height over time is given by $f(t) = 1+ 3t - t^2$. What is its average velocity from $t_1=0$ to $t_2=1$? $t_2=0.1$? $t_2=h$? What happens when $h \to 0$?</div>


        <div class="definition">The <u>instantaneous velocity</u> at a time, $t$, is the limit of average velocity about the time, $t$, as the length of time defining the average goes to zero.</div>

        In the last example what is instantaneous velocity when the ball is first thrown (i.e., when $t=0$)?

        <div class="example">The following table shows a skateboarder's position at various times:

            <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
                <tr>
                    <td>t (seconds)</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>m (meters)</td><td>2.7</td><td>3.4</td><td>3.8</td><td>8.6</td><td>10.1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <ol>
                <li>What is the avg vel on interval, $[0,2]$?</li>
                <li>What is the avg vel on interval, $[1,4]$?</li>
                <li>What is the avg vel on interval, $[3,4]$?</li>
            </ol>
