    <h1>A short guide on using <code>f2py</code> to call Fortran subroutines from Python</h1>

    <h2>Preliminaries</h2>

    <p>
        It is assumed that you have Python, <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> installed. If not, you can find many instructions around the web for installing these.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python is a scripting language, while Numpy and Matplotlib are Python modules (or libraries) for scientific computing and plotting respectively. This is not a guide specificly on using these libraries &mdash; although, they are great, and you should try them out in more detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>f2py</code> is a command line utility that is included with Numpy that converts files containing Fortran subroutines or modules into Python modules. This allows you to code your numerical routines in Fortran, while allowing Python scripts to "drive" the main program for plotting, etc. You can find more detail about <code>f2py</code> by reading its <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/">User guide and reference manual</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Reading text image data from a file and thresholding it in Fortran</h2>
    As an example, we will 
    <ol>
        <li>Read a square image stored in a file as text data into Python as a double precision matrix.</li>
        <li>Pass the image to a Fortran subroutine that thresholds the values of the matrix.</li>
        <li>Return the image back to the Python script and plot the results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Writing the Fortran routine</h3>

    Let's assume we have a file, <a href="./my_lib.f90"><code>my_lib.f90</code></a>, containing one or more Fortran subroutines that looks like the following:

    <pre>
    <code>
        subroutine threshold_image(image, n, threshold, output)
            ! Inputs: image, n, threshold.
            ! Output: output
            !   output(i,j) is 1 if image(i,j) > threshold and 0 otherwise.

            integer n
            real(8) threshold
            real(8), dimension(n,n) :: image, output

            !f2py intent(in) :: image, threshold
            !f2py intent(hide), depend(image) :: n = shape(image, 0)
            !f2py intent(out) output

            write(*,*) "Hello from the Fortran subroutine!"

            ! Loop through columns and rows and threshold the image.
            do j=1,n
                do i=1,n
                    if (image(i,j) > threshold) then
                        output(i,j) = 1.0
                    else
                        output(i,j) = 0.0
                    end if
                end do
            end do
        end subroutine
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>This subroutine has 3 special comments that start with <code>!f2py</code>:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first tells <code>f2py</code> that the variables <code>image</code> and <code>threshold</code> are required inputs when called from Python.</li>
        <li>The second tells <code>f2py</code> that the variable <code>n</code> is defined implicitly through the <code>image</code> argument when called from Python, and its value is the size of the first dimension of <code>image</code></li>
        <li>The third tells <code>f2py</code> that the variable, <code>output</code>, does not need to be provided as an argument when called from Python, and the variable is in fact returned by the function when called from Python. If multiple variables are returned, they are returned as a Python Tuple.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Compiling the Fortran file to a Python module</h3>
    <p>From the command line where the file is present, run</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
        f2py -c -m my_lib my_lib.f90
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A new file is produced, <code>my_lib.so</code>, which can be imported into Python.</p>

    <h3>Testing the routine from a Python script</h3>

    <p>Let's take a <a href="./image.txt">square image stored as a text file</a>, and test our routine. Write a file, <a href="./main.py">main.py</a>, containing:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        import my_lib as ml

        # Read matrix from text file as double precision matrix.
        I = np.genfromtxt('./image.txt', dtype=np.float64)

        # Threshold value.
        t = 0.3

        # Call the fortran routine.
        T = ml.threshold_image(image=I, threshold=t)

        # Plot the images.
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)

        axes[0].imshow(I, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        axes[0].axis('off'); axes[0].set_title('Original')

        axes[1].imshow(T, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        axes[1].axis('off'); axes[1].set_title('Thresholded at %.2f' % t)

        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>And run it from the command line:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
        python main.py
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>If successful, you should see both the original and thresholded image displayed as well as a the line "Hello from the Fortran subroutine!" printed.</p>
